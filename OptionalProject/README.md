##Optional Project

Project is to develop a program that receives infix expressions, convert them to postfix expressions, and then evaluate the produced post expressions.
This uses a GUI to do that.

####Examples of input:
1)  10 * (5 - 3) + 75  /  52    x ( 2 + 3)

2)  8 / 4 + 7 * ( 5 + 2) - 33 * 2  

3)  (5 + 3) * 2 - 10 + 4 * (4-1)
